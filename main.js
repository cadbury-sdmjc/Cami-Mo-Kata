/* 

MonKee is hungry and looking to jump up some trees to fetch bananas for lunch. It can only jump one or three trees up at a time. Work out the minimum number of jumps required for the monkey to get from start to finish and return an array containing as many bananas as the number of jumps: e.g. 4 jumps -> ["banana", "banana", "banana", "banana"]. The start and end numbers will always be integers (incl 0)
